    "# Challenge:\n",
    "The problem consists in predicting the probability of delay of the flights that land or take off from the airport of Santiago de Chile (SCL). For that you will have a dataset using public and real data where each row corresponds to a flight that landed or took off from SCL during 2017. The following information is available for each flight:\n",
    "Fecha-I: Scheduled date and time of the flight.\n",
    "Vlo-I : Scheduled flight number.\n",
    "Ori-I : Programmed origin city code.\n",
    "Des-I : Programmed destination city code.\n",
    "Emp-I : Scheduled flight airline code.\n",
    "Fecha-O : Date and time of flight operation.\n",
    "Vlo-O : Flight operation number of the flight.\n",

    "1. How is the data distributed? Did you find any noteworthy insight to share? What can you conclude about this?\n",

    "○ delay_15 : 1 if min_diff > 15, 0 if not.\n",

    "4. Train one or several models (using the algorithm(s) of your choice) to estimate the likelihood of a flight delay.\n",
    "Feel free to generate additional variables and/or supplement with external variables.\n",
    "5. Evaluate model performance in the predictive task across each model that you trained. Define and justify what metrics you used\n",

    "in this notebook i will develop a model that predicts the probability of delay of the flights that land or take off from the SCL airport.\n",
    "For this, we have a dataset called \"dataset_SCL.csv\", the porpuse is to obtain all the questions above and be very clear on the various steps needed to build this. There will be **important** concepts and steps, like the EDA steps, separation of the dataset in the training stage, making cross-validation to determine accurate model parameters.\n",

    "For this, python gives us tools to acomplish this with:\n",
    "- data manipulation: pandas, numpy\n",
